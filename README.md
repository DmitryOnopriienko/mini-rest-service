# REST Service using Spring Data JPA

I have developed REST Service with tables Waybills *-- Customers.
I have been using MySQL DB with name 'testdb'. I have not developed tests yet, 
but I will in couple of days (actually, there are some tests for [CustomerController](src/test/java/com/restservice/profitsoftlec911/CustomerControllerTest.java)). Because of problems with electricity I have
done assignment late, sorry

## I have done tests for [CustomerController](src/test/java/com/restservice/profitsoftlec911/CustomerControllerTest.java)
